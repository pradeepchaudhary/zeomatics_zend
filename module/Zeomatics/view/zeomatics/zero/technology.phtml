                    <p>The practice of creating maps or visual representations of a surface from above it is known as Cartography. Traditionally maps have always on paper, but since the introduction & wide spread use of GIS, cartography has evolved more into digital formats. Most maps today are now generated using map software that falls into one of three main types; GIS, CAD, and specialized map graphic design software.</p>
                    <p>A quick sketch is worth a thousand words : mapmaking is the art of making geographic information intelligible in the form of an image that has both meaning and beauty. Cartographic savoir-faire, formerly altogether manual, has been transformed by computerization and the introduction of tools which can improve the craftsman’s productivity while maintaining the same degree of high quality.</p>
                    <p>Cartography is therefore a discipline at the crossroads of several others : Visual Arts, Vision studies, Physical and Human Geography, Statistics, Geomatics and Computer science.</p>

                    <strong>The GIS usually has 5 feature classes : </strong>

                        <li><strong>Abstraction </strong>: the GIS offers a model of the real world in a synthesized, often hierarchical view ;</li>

                        <li><strong>Storage </strong>: to distribute, sell or share data, and to integrate it into a great number of different types of software ;</li>
                        <li><strong>Display </strong>: geographic data are usually represented on a screen in 2D, but sometimes with 3D viewing methods ;</li>

                    <p>Remote sensing is the science of acquiring information about a surface without physically being in contact with it. Remote sensors collect data by detecting the energy that is reflected from Earth. These sensors can be on satellites or mounted on aircraft. The most common example of remote sensing is aerial photography however there are hundreds of  applications ranging from space-borne satellites to under-ground geophysical systems.</p>
                    <p>Remote sensors can be either passive or active. Passive sensors respond to external stimuli. They record radiation that is reflected from Earth’s surface, usually from the sun. Because of this, passive sensors can only be used to collect data during daylight hours.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, active sensors use internal stimuli to collect data about Earth. For example, a laser-beam remote sensing system projects a laser onto the surface of Earth and measures the time that it takes for the laser to reflect back to its sensor.</p>
                    <strong>Remote sensing has a wide range of applications in many different fields:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Coastal applications:</strong> Monitor shoreline changes, track sediment transport, and map coastal features. Data can be used for coastal mapping and erosion prevention.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ocean applications:</strong> Monitor ocean circulation and current systems, measure ocean temperature and wave heights, and track sea ice. Data can be used to better understand the oceans and how to best manage ocean resources.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hazard assessment:</strong> Track hurricanes, earthquakes, erosion, and flooding. Data can be used to assess the impacts of a natural disaster and create preparedness strategies to be used before and after a hazardous event.</li>
                        <li><strong>Natural resource management:</strong> Monitor land use, map wetlands, and chart wildlife habitats. Data can be used to minimize the damage that urban growth has on the environment and help decide how to best protect natural resources.</li>

                    <p>Bathymetry is the study and mapping of seafloor topography. It involves obtaining measurements of the depth of the ocean and is equivalent to mapping the topography on land.</p>
                    <p>The term “bathymetry” originally referred to the ocean’s depth relative to sea level, although it has come to mean “submarine topography,” or the depths and shapes of underwater terrain.</p>
                    <p>In the same way that topographic maps represent the three-dimensional features (or relief) of overland terrain, bathymetric maps illustrate the land that lies underwater. Variations in sea-floor relief may be depicted by color and contour lines called depth contours or isobaths.</p>
                    <p>Bathymetry is the foundation of the science of hydrography, which measures the physical features of a water body.  Hydrography includes not only bathymetry, but also the shape and features of the shoreline; the characteristics of tides, currents, and waves; and the physical and chemical properties of the water itself.</p>
                    <strong>Such measurements can be made using:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Multibeam (swath) echosounders</li>
                        <li>Airborne laser measurements (LADS)</li>
                        <li>Derived depths from satellite remote sensing</li>
                        <li>Singlebeam echosounders</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Bathymetry is used by engineering companies to site undersea cables, oil rigs and seafloor pipelines. The data may be used also for more specialised activities such as identifying the extent of man-made bio-hazards or for locating material which have escaped onto, or sunk to, the seafloor. Australia's fishing industry also use bathymetric data to identify possible locations for deep sea fishing.</p>

                    In response to this, zeomatics can be commissioned to carry out aerial thermal surveys using a Thermal Airborne Imager™ (TABI), which measures relative heat loss from buildings, landfill sites and industrial sources.
                    </p><p>
                    Using this airborne instrument, both urban and rural areas can be surveyed quickly and cost effectively. Our automated referencing systems give unsurpassed precision, meaning that imagery can be seamlessly matched to buildings located on OS Mastermap™. Statistics of the temperature values within each building polygon are used to assign each address and out-building with an indicative heat loss rating.
                    </p><p>
                    This powerful tool makes it easy to monitor heat loss from commercial and domestic properties and develop targeted energy efficiency plans. The imager can also be used in environmental monitoring to detect industrial thermal discharge into watercourses, oil spillage and heat anomalies on landfill sites.
                    </p><p>
                    Image data can be supplied in a variety of formats to suit the application requirements, with different levels of processing on offer from raw image data to fully analysed data products.

                    <p>Used predominately for environmental monitoring, CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) is a flexible mapping tool capable of multispectral and hyperspectral imaging. This powerful optical imager from ITRES measures reflected light from the visible and near infrared portion of the spectrum (between 400nm and 1000nm), which is split into multiple and discrete image bands.</p>
                    <p>This multispectral imagery is automatically and accurately orthorectified using data from the LIDAR system. The imagery's spatial resolution can be as fine as 50cm and it is map ready so can be used directly in GIS and image processing software.</p>
